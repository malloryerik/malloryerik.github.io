		<i>You've looked at the traditional four grammatical types of sentences. Those are interesting, but let's look further, at what some people feel are the five types of things you can <span class="underline">do</span> with sentences and language. Here we'll mainly look at a set of ideas from Professor John Searle.</i>
	    </p>

	    <p>
		<i>His is just one way of looking at language, but I've chosen it because it so closely resembles or looks like the our list of types of grammatical sentences.</i>
	    </p>

		<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Speech Acts</h2>
		<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
		    <p>
"Speech act theory" is a way of looking at language. By "speech acts," we mean things we say or write that have a purpose or a function in communication &#x2013; words that "do things."
		    </p>

		    <p>
This idea says that language doesn't simply pass around information. Instead, it <i>does</i> things in our social world. In fact, it could be said that our human world is literally built out of and organized through speech acts.
		    </p>

		    <p>
Language allows us to make the promises, agreements, commands, statements and declarations that let us live and act together with great numbers of people &#x2013;  thousands, even millions or billions of humans can work together, whether by agreement, command, promise, or declaration. 
		    </p>

		    <p>
According to this way of thinking, speech acts are the basic building blocks of the social world. Doctor's prescriptions, declarations of war, personal property, promotions in employment, laws, contracts, geology clubs, credit cards, legal punishments, science conventions, armies, measurement standards, app stores, marriages, school systems, and even countries themselves are created and maintained through speech acts, and would be impossible without them.
		    </p>
		    <p>
Speech act theory has become influential in areas like philosophy, psychology, legal theory, artificial intelligence and machine learning.
		    </p>

		<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> There are five types of speech acts:</h2>
		<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
		    <p>
Despite this, it is possible to reduce all "actions through language" or speech acts into just five categories: assertives, directives, commissives, expressives, and declaratives.
		    </p>

		    <p>
In Searle's system, a speech act is defined by the <b>intention</b> behind it, or by what the speaker (or writer) is actually trying to do with their utterance or message. 
		    </p>

		    <p>
Here are the five types:
		    </p>

"If I ask them, I think they will agree." "He saw the moon reflected in her eyes." "Apollo sent a plague on Thebes."
			    </li>
			    <li><b>Goal:</b> To represent how things are, and to get others to agree to this representation. Succeeds if others agree that the representation is correct.
			    </li>
			    <li><b>Before speech act:</b> belief
			    </li>
			    <li><b>Direction of fit:</b> The words try to match the state of the world (word-to-world).

			    </li>

			    </li>
			    <li><b>Before speech act:</b> desire, want

				    <li>"We &#x2026; Representatives of the united States of America &#x2026; solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are &#x2026; Free and Independent States"
				    </li>
				    <li>Another written example could include for example an airline's flight schedule, because the company thereby declares that such and such flights will happen at this and that hour.

			    </li>
			    <li><b>Goal:</b> To make something be a certain way by declaring or saying that it is that way.
In other words, <span class="underline">to create facts in the world.</span>
			    </li>
			    <li><b>Before speech act:</b> Nothing! Desire or intention may have come before the declarative speech act, but it itself has no prelinguistic state. 
			    </li>
			    <li><b>Direction of fit:</b> Both! Declaratives try to make the world match the word <b>and</b> the word match the world <span class="underline">at the same time</span>. Maybe this is part of their magic.

		    <h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Direct and Indirect Speech Acts</h3>
		    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
			<p>
There are both "direct" and "indirect" speech acts. <i>Indirect</i> speech acts are when we imply but don't directly state something, and also sometimes when we include several meanings in one utterance (saying). We might be masking our intentions, or adding layers meaning.
			</p>

			<p>
Indirect: "If we don't go now we'll be late."
Direct: "Let's go now, because otherwise we'll be late."
			</p>

			<p>
			    <i>At a dinner party, the host speaking</i>
Indirect: "I'm getting sleepy."
Direct: "It's time for you to go home" (Directive), or maybe, "The dinner party is over" (Declaration).
			</p>


			<p>
These are both <i>directive</i> speech acts (giving directions, "let's go") even though the indirect version is grammatically a statement ("declarative sentence"), and only the second is gramatically a command ("imperative sentence").
			</p>

			<p>
[Confusing, right? A declarative in grammar is an assertive in speech act theory. Aigo!]
			</p>

			<p>
A single sentence  may combine speech acts. Think of a complaint. A grumpy guy bought a pair of headphones from e-Mart. He returns to e-Mart and goes to the refund desk. "I'm sorry to tell you this but these headphones I bought don't work, they sound like you're listening underwater and the left ear bud is louder than the right earbud, so I'm very unhappy."
			</p>

			<p>
What kinds of speech acts are being used?
			</p>

			<p>
There are elements of respresentative (describing his beliefs about the headphones) and Expressive (sharing his mood), but overall, what is the speaker's intention?
Right! He wants his money back, or a new pair of headphones. So what he is mostly <i>doing</i> is making a request, an implied or indirect directive, "give me a refund or new pair of headphones," and this request is being backed up, justified by the respresentative statement that "these don't work right."

		    <h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Final notes:</h3>
		    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
			<p>
Here, I've chosen to mainly discuss the speech act theory developed by a famous professor named John Searle. There are other competing versions, but his is probably the most widely accepted, and it's the one with which I'm most familiar&#x2026;
			</p>

			<p>
In other versions, Complaints might have their own spot as a unique kind of speech act, for example.
			</p>


			<p>
You'll notice that the types all end in "-ive," like "declarative."
			</p>

			<p>
-ive
			</p>

			<p>
a suffix of adjectives <b>(and nouns of adjectival origin)</b> expressing tendency, disposition, function, connection, etc. &#x2013; Causing and making.
			</p>

			<p>
active; corrective; destructive; detective; passive; sportive.
			</p>

			<p>
Compare -ative, -itive.
			</p>

			<p>
So, a declarative message declares. A representative message represents. A commissive speech act commits the speaker to a future actions, like when I made the promise that I'd explain something about speech act theory to you ^^ .
